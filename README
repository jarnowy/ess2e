This document is an attempt to give you the essential information that you 
will need in order to use the LaTeX Document Preparation System. Only very 
basic features are covered, and a vast amount of detail has been omitted.
This essential information should allow the user to typeset a non-technical 
document fully.

The main directory contains the original and newer material; the RWK 
directory contains the extensions originally written by Richard W. Kaye, 
University of Birmingham.
